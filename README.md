# algorithms

## Scope   
The raison d’être of this repository is two-fold.  
Most importantly, it is a place, where I store and test my knowledge and understanding of algorithms and data structures on an abstract level.   
Additionally, this repository can help a person that is not myself to get to know where I stand in my expertise and what is my coding style.   
    
All algorithms and data structures are implemented an an abstract level, for the sake of clarity and to make the process of reusing them easier.
